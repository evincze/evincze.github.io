                <h1>The Playtester - Binary Bandits</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    This was a game that I worked on called "The Playtester" that was created for the 2024 TO Jam. Me and 2 other programmers completed this game in 2.5 days.
                    My duties during the development of the game include the player movement and input, creating UI menus such as a pause menu and a settings menu. I also created the audio system for voice lines and sound effects.

                <h1>RPG Project - George Brown College</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    This is a school project that I worked on in my second year of college where I was tasked with creating an RPG game. I worked on this project completely by myself, I created an audio system, battle system, dialogue system, etc. I also worked on the player and NPC movement,
                    main menu screen, settings screen and also the pause screen. For the battle system I have a feature similar to Earthbound where depending on how the battle starts, either the player or the enemy will have advantage in battle with a first move. In my battle
                    system there is also elemental damage depending on the attack type the player uses and the enemy's element type.

                <h1>Cells At War (Nucleus Minigame) - George Brown College / McMasters University</h1>
                <hr />
                <p>
                    This is a minigame that I worked on during my third year at George Brown College. I was asked if I wanted to participate in creating a game for Biology Students at McMaster University. I was giving the task to program a system to generate certain nucleotides as the game progresses.
                    I programmed a way to move the groups of DNA across the screen to wait for the players input and created a way to undo the last move and retry.
